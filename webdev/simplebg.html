      A funny example comes to mind. In my childhood, I used to absolutely
      love sticking one end of a strand of Maggi noodles in my mouth
      leaving the other end hanging outside: a long thread of noodle
      hanging down from the mouth.  Then, I used to suck on the strand
      quickly.

      Consequently, the hanging noodleâ€™s length would shorten rapidly and
      it would rush into my mouth dancing around as it went in. Now to
      ensure that such long strands survived in the final product, it was
      critical that the Maggi units remained unbroken while cooking them.
      So, I let then boil in water and unravel by themselves.  While
      cooking Maggi the other day, I realized that this behavior has
      become so ingrained in me, that it is completely automatic for me
      not to break the units while cooking even today.

      This, even though I stopped playing with noodle strands long ago.
      Now imagine the collective entirety of such instances, such small
      preferences and idiosyncrasies. Every single person would have their
      own set of beliefs and choices that they made as children or the
      environment they grew in, which would shape them into the way they
      are today.
